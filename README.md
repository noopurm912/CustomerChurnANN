### Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
##### Churn is defined as the loss of a customer or a client from any bussiness. Churn rate is a measure of the number of customers leaving a collective group over a specific period. Traditionally, bussinesses can only know about the customers leaving only when they show their intentions to the company then customer retention is the solution to customer churn by providing different offers or the best solution possible. Churn prediction analysis is critical to predict the possiblity of a customer leaving even before they express their intentations. The companies can offer or improve the current services to retain their customers. The goal is to understand and take steps to change it before the costumer gives up the product or service. The customer data can be analyze the pattern or any important information to predict the customer churn. We can use classification algorithm or Artificial Neural Network model to make those prediction.

### Artificial Neural Network: 
##### Artificial neural networks (ANNs),also called as neural networks (NNs), are computing systems inspired by the the neural Networks in our brain. An ANN is a collection of connected units or nodes also called neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Deep learning uses artificial neural networks that behaves similarly to the neural networks in our brain. A neural network works when some input data is fed to it and this data is processed via layers of perceptron to produce a output.

##### Keras: Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models. It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries such as TensorFlow and allows to define and train neural network models.
